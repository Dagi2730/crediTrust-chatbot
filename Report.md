Exploratory Data Analysis Summary
The cleaned dataset comprises 82,164 consumer complaints focused on five key financial products: Credit Cards, Personal Loans, Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL), Savings Accounts, and Money Transfers. The distribution of complaints shows varying volumes across these products, highlighting which areas receive the most customer feedback.

Narrative length analysis reveals most complaints contain detailed descriptions with an average word count indicative of substantial input from consumers. There are, however, 329 very short narratives (under 10 words) which may lack sufficient context for in-depth analysis, as well as 5,380 very long narratives (over 500 words), which will require effective chunking strategies for embedding without loss of information.

Overall, the dataset is rich with valuable consumer feedback, and the identified narrative length extremes will guide the preprocessing steps for semantic search and language model input.
