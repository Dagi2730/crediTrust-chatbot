i could donate 500 i agreed to donate 500 he entered 500 into a handheld device showed it to me his phone which had a credit card scanner attached to it i tapped my previous now cancelled card on the

were entered as 500000 not the 500 i agreed to donate for the xxxx s xxxx costs what i find to be citibank s fault is that after recognizing the first 500000 as fraudulent and declining the charge and recommending i immediately cancel the card which i did within a few minutes of the fraudulent transaction s citi then processed xxxx more identical charges and transferred them to a new account they setup for me after cancelling the card that was used at the time of the incident in their most recent letter they mentioned that the xxxx and xxxx charges were processed by them during a period of security closure clearance which was after the first charge was declined by citicard and after the card presented at the time of the incident was cancelled i received no notification from citi of the xxxx and xxxx charges but they themselves recognized the xxxx charge of 500000 was fraudulent and declined it i have sent them numerous documents and have also engaged an attorney xxxx xxxx to help me resolve this matter i can provide all the documents to cfpb at your request after citicard received the first communication from my attorney which advised citi to not contact me directly they did call me directly anyway also after the incident on xxxxxxxx i had numerous calls and spoke with several representatives from citibank who all told me i would not be held responsible for any of the xxxx 500000 charges from xxxx xxxx xxxxxxxx xxxx on the afternoon of xxxxxxxx i have provided cfpb with several of the documents submitted as evidence that this was deceptive criminal practices and that

representatives at a different time i spoke with xxxx id xxxx at the citi xxxx fraud team us phone number xxxx on that call and several others citibank representatives told me that i would not be held be responsible for these charges my credit card statement and written correspondence received much later confirm a different message citicard continues to restate that since i was scammed it was not a fraudulent charge and that since i provided my card for a 500 payment i am responsible for xxxx charges of 500000 the xxxx of which citicards themselves recognized as fraudulent and knew to decline they called me minutes after the incident occured incoming phone record provided in attachments so citicards clearly recognized the xxxx charge was fraudulentsuspicious activity the xxxx and xxxx charges were processed by citicard with no notification or authorization by me and after the card had been cancelled citi continues to assert that i approved the charges because i presented my credit card this is puzzling i present my credit card at every in person transaction but if any other store or vendor were to tell me something was 500 and then attempt to charge me 500000 xxxx times and they allowed it to go through i would think citi should understand this is the fault of their own processing systems,0

13942090,Checking or savings account,on xxxxyear2025 us bank charged a 1200 fee to my checking account previously they waived the 600 monthly maintenance fee as long as i maintained another consumer credit card with them which i still do without any clear notice or communication the bank appears to have changed the terms and increased the fee i did not receive any communication by email physical mail or secure message informing me that the terms of my account would change or that the fee waiver would no longer apply additionally i could not find any notice of this change on their website or in any other logical location where a customer would expect to be informed this feels like a classic baitandswitch tactic i contacted us bank to express my concern despite being a longtime customer with both a checking account and two credit cards and never having been charged any maintenance or credit card fees before they refused to offer even a onetime courtesy waiver for what should reasonably be considered a firsttime occurrence this practice seems deceptive and unfair im requesting the cfpbs assistance in investigating whether us bank failed to meet its obligation to clearly and timely disclose changes in account terms and whether its refusal to waive the fee in this instance violates standards for fair customer treatment,0

13942640,Credit card,i am submitting this complaint regarding a deceptive and inconsistent interest charge on one of my citi credit cards despite paying the full statement balance during the billing cycle and having a 000 balance reflected afterward i was told by a citi customer service manager that i needed to make two consecutive full payments to stop being charged interest even though i had already paid the balance in full during the billing cycle this makes absolutely no sense as a second full payment would be impossible with a 000 balance the representative could not clearly explain why interest continued to accrue and the explanation felt intentionally confusing what makes this worse is that i have another citi credit card that did not charge interest under the same exact conditions i also have cards with two other banks that do not engage in this practice this inconsistent application of policy is unfair misleading and appears to be an intentional effort to trap consumers in a cycle of residual interest and revolving debt when i asked for an email address to file a written complaint i was told citi does not offer any email option and that i had to send a physical letter through the mail this is unacceptable in 2025 and is clearly intended to make it harder for customers to document and resolve issues,0

13644018,Credit card,i experienced a xxxx and xxxx xxxx in early 2025 which caused me to miss payments on several credit cards once i was safe and able to take action i logged into the wells fargo mobile app and chose to pay the full total balance displayed 770000 on xxxxscrub 2025 the app also showed a smaller statement balance but i intentionally chose the total balance so that all interest penalties and fees would be covered and the card brought to xxxx immediately after submitting that payment the app showed a new charge of 4000 but i was blocked from paying it the app said i couldnt make another payment because one had just been processed i had to wait a day before i was allowed to pay the 4000 which i did on xxxxyear2025 that again brought the balance to zero a month later wells fargo added another charge 5800 which they claimed was for interest and penalties related to the late payment i contacted them to explain i understood i had been late i deliberately paid the full total balance not the statement balance and then paid the unexpected 4000 as soon as the app allowed i was asking them to let me pay everything they claimed i owed including any interest and late fees to fully resolve and close the matter instead of giving me a final payoff amount they kept replying but you paid it late and refused to accept that i was repeatedly trying to pay everything off in full i kept telling them i know its late but i should be able to pay everything i owe interest and penalties on an account that has been closed for months instead of this engineered perpetual circular debt that can not be resolved and all they would say is but you paid it late in repetition and that interest and penalties will continue to accrue as long as you pay late even though i kept paying the full amounts as soon as they were shown to me i was told but you paid late in repetition to me saying i know that but was attempting to pay everything i owed including late fees and interest so that no charges would occur again like they couldnt hear me or were trying to anger me and that interest and penalties will continue to accrue as long as you pay late as if i wasnt trying to satisfy the account paying all fees interest and principle without delay i was paying the entire total balance as soon as a balance was shown trying to resolve it completely despite my full payments each time a balance appeared new charges would reappear and i was again told theyll keep occurring as long as you pay late this made it impossible to escape the loop despite my repeated efforts to bring the account to xxxx other credit card companies i dealt with during this time simply allowed me to pay what i owed and closed the account wells fargo was the only one that refused to accept full payment and kept the account in a fee loop today after extensive back and forth they finally told me they will allow me to pay the 5800 and bring the balance to xxxx without adding more charges i will monitor the account to confirm however i still believe their behavior was intentional and exploitative why im filing this complaint the app misrepresented total balance as a complete payoff but allowed new charges immediately afterward and then continue to accrue fees i was blocked from paying the 4000 that appeared immediately after the full payment when i wanted to pay all fees wells fargo refused to provide a final payoff amount even after i paid in full and then again they told me interest and penalties would continue to accrue as long as i pay late despite my efforts to pay the full balance and all charges each time they appeared they kept me in a billing loop while insisting on a vague explanation you paid late this conduct caused confusion and emotional distress during an already traumatic situation and i believe it was predatory by design,0

13750104,Credit card,i have 2 balances simultaneously held on my citi xxxx credit card one is a promotional 0 balance transfer set to expire in xxxxxxxx and the second is a small purchase balance at the normal purchase apr of 2699 i understood that the minimum balance paid is applied to whatever balance citibank decides but my understanding was that any monetary amount paid besides the minimum balance is meant to be applied to balances with the highest interest rate first however this is not what occurred for my xxxx statement billing cycle dates xxxx i was advised the minimum payment due was 12000 the purchase apr balance i am attempting to pay off was listed as 8300 on the xxxx statement thus i made sure to pay more than the minimum payment however on my xxxx statement billing cycle dates xxxx although it shows i made a total payment of 35000 which is 22000 more than the minimum payment required and part of which should have been applied to the purchase apr balance the xxxx statement still shows me carrying a purchase balance of 7000 this means the extra money i paid on top of the minimum payment was not applied to the highest interest rate balance the purchase balance when i called citibank credit card customer service for an explanation on xxxxxxxx i was advised i would have to pay off the entire promotional balance transfer first before the payment will apply properly to the purchase balance i told the customer service agent that there are regulations applicable to credit card payments that prevent the bank from arbitrarily applying payments in regards to multiple balances with multiple interest rates and that payments greater than the minimum balance should be applied in a way that prioritizes balances with the higher interest rate but she insisted that the information she gave me was correct i did not want to argue with an agent who could not assist me which led to this complaint being submitted,0

13675416,Credit card,im filing this complaint to report what i believe is an abusive lending pattern by citibank i had a citi credit card with an interest rate of nearly 30 2824 over time this rate became unsustainable not due to irresponsible spending but because the compounding interest made it mathematically impossible to keep up i fell behind on payments and only after defaulting was i offered a 0 hardship plan but that help only came after the damage was done including damaged credit and months of late fees and stress i contacted citi to request help before defaulting and was denied their current response only defends the legality of the apr under south dakota law without acknowledging the systemic impact of their policy this is part of a wider pattern banks use high interest to predictably drive struggling customers into default then offer help that arrives too late that is not transparent or responsible lending im asking the cfpb to investigate this model i am also filing parallel complaints with the occ and florida attorney general to pursue oversight and accountability,0
13756653,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",this is complex with both this app xxxx and the xxxxxxxx xxxx and likely others specifically ive been in the most contact with xxxx though and they are the ones selfadmittedly refusing to pay me the money i earned through their app tasking which was also deceptive and cost me 7600 just to earn 5100 both apps are scams but ultimately xxxx owes me at least 5100 which ive been communicating to them for over a month and they continue to in writing acknowledge their fault their taking down of the feature to earn cash and refusal to pay anything at all in return xxxx has an earn cash feature once available for weeks or at least ever since i used the app to earn cash you complete a select number of tasks like most legit apps ie xxxx xxxx is one of xxxxxxxx xxxx partners xxxx is a cashback scheme which deceptively incentivizes requires the user to pay to cash out their earnings that they paid for and only then can then be redeemed on xxxxxxxx xxxx app allegedly xxxx does not explain this the verification fee to use your own money is 3000 for example they make false claims to spin a wheel which is required to take your xxxx earnings allegedly however money earned from spins is not available without paying more money verifying for 3000 etc in the end you spin far more than you earn which is a system put into place ion purpose as they dont reveal this until youve reached a certain earning only to be told you cant have it without paying another fee it is a classic cashback and in this case also a cryptocurrency scheme resembling a pyramid scheme of sorts xxxx claims they cant verify the user id and that is why they cant pay out the funds however they never mention this until youve done the work downloaded the scam apps like xxxx paid heavily and given your entire banking information including login credentials and transactions to xxxx who now has all your banking information and insights and you have no way to revoke it without abandoning your earned cash though some users report you cant revoke their ownership of your credentials at all despite having your banking information in great detail they claim they cant verify who you are and use this as their excuse to not pay for what you accomplish in the earn cash segment of their app which is totally separate bear in mind i am not requesting a cash advance from the app the earn cash is a totally separate segment unrelated like xxxx earnings or survey earnings the difference is they rely on cashback and crypto schemes as their third party apps who earn huge amounts of money only to never be returned to the user for even a quarter of the amount by xxxx who makes you wait until you reach xxxx points or 3000 i reached 5100 to tell you theres an error adn weeks later that you cant have any of the funds and your account is void of course they still have unlimited free reign of your bank account and all your identifying information despite not being able to verify id allegedly after a month of back and forth with customer service and weeklong waits for generic responses and refusals to help xxxx reached out saying he has since removed the earn cash feature completely to avoid this situation but even still refuses to pay the 5100 i earned after paying 7600 to xxxx xxxx admitted their mistake in writing but will not pay and hid the earnings from view i have screenshots of all this,0

13671575,Checking or savings account,i have been living xxxx for the past 9 years and have had limited need for regular usbased banking services i kept my citibank account open with the intention of returning to the us and maintained a minimum balance at the same time ive continued to maintain a us account with another bank without any issues they allow me to keep the account open without monthly fees as long as i meet the minimum balance requirement which ive done consistently my citibank account was locked due to inactivity i was instructed to submit a notarized document to restore access unfortunately getting a notary appointment at the us xxxx in xxxx was difficult due to very limited availability after multiple delays i had to hire a private notary and pay xxxxxxxx mailing costs all at my own expense just to meet citibanks requirements citibank had also closed its consumer banking operations where i live a few years ago so i had no access to local support during this period i had absolutely no access to my account and could not even close it to avoid fees despite this citibank charged me 1500 per month for six months totaling 9000 in service fees eventually citibank refunded 3000 as a courtesy but refused to reimburse the remaining 6000 i was told the refund was capped and not subject to further review i believe this is unfair i was charged for a service i could not use this experience has been frustrating and disappointing especially considering that i tried to maintain the account from abroad while i do intend to close my citibank account following this experience i strongly believe the issue should be addressed and resolved fairly before i do so,0

12813629,Credit card,my partner and i planned a trip to xxxx xxxx from xxxxxxxx to xxxxxxxx including a backpacking tour through xxxx and visits to multiple cities in xxxx tragically her mother passed away about a week before our departure forcing us to cancel the trip i had prepaid for my airline tickets and tour operator bookings using my chase sapphire preferred credit card under the trip cancellation insurance benefit outlined in the chase sapphire guide to benefits i believe i should be reimbursed for these expenses specifically the guide states that the benefit provides reimbursement for eligible travel expenses charged to the card if the cancellation is due to a loss of life of an immediate family member of you or your traveling companion the guide defines a traveling companion as an individual who has made advanced arrangements with you to travel together for all or part of the trip my partner meets this definition as we planned the trip together had shared tour and lodging bookings and coordinated our flights i provided chase with evidence of these arrangements including flight confirmations receipts and text messages despite this chase denied my claim stating only per the guide to benefits the traveler who experienced the loss is not a covered traveler while it is true that my partner is not a chase cardholder this should not matter i am the cardholder who paid for my own travel costs with the sapphire preferred card which makes me an eligible traveler and i had a traveling companion whose immediate family member passed away as explicitly covered in the terms i appealed the decision and clarified the logic above but chase denied my appeal without citing any specific language from the guide to benefits multiple chase representatives declined to explain the reasoning behind the denial or identify any specific terms that disqualified me to be clear i am not requesting reimbursement for my partners travel expenses i am only seeking reimbursement for my own prepaid expenses charged to my sapphire preferred card under clearly stated terms of the benefit additionally i have a separate unresolved claim related to this same trip i used my chase freedom unlimited card to pay a 150000 tour operator fee chase advertises that freedom unlimited cardholders receive trip cancellation and interruption insurance of up to 150000 per covered traveler i submitted a claim in xxxx but despite sending all required documentation including some items multiple times chase has still not resolved or ruled on the claim after more than three months i am filing this complaint because i believe chase has failed to honor the terms of its advertised travel insurance protection and has not provided transparent or timely customer service in addressing my claims,0

13750269,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",dear cfpb i am filing a formal complaint against payward ventures inc dba kraken due to their failure to detect and prevent fraudulent activity in my account resulting in significant financial loss and their subsequent claim that i am responsible for not only all of the funds lost during this process but even the funds that kraken covered and sent to an unknown address despite obvious fraud i believe kraken s handling of the situation and their lack of proper fraud protection is unjust and has caused me significant emotional and financial harm incident overview on xxxxyear xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxxxxxx in the xxxx i was xxxx and xxxx in xxxx during the incident i was xxxx and as a result of this coercion the fraudsters gained unauthorized access to my accounts including my xxxx account the case numbers related to this incident are as follows metropolitan police case number xxxx xxxx reference number xxxx national fraud reference number xxxx xxxx fraudulent transfers and krakens response kraken has claimed that i am responsible for the fraudulent activity in my account specifically the 500000 transfer despite the fact that the fraud was evident and easily detectable this claim is unjustified for the following reasons fraudulent transfer of 500000 the fraudsters initiated a 500000 transfer from my bank account to purchase xxxx xxxx on kraken although my bank detected this fraud immediately and froze my account kraken proceeded with the transfer even though the funds had not fully settled the fraudsters then immediately transferred the xxxx to their own wallet kraken continued processing this transaction without detecting any suspicious activity even though my bank had already stopped the transaction and flagged it as fraudulent this led to a 500000 deficit in my kraken account for which kraken is now holding me responsible despite my bank taking immediate action to prevent the fraudulent transfer failure to prevent fraudulent withdrawal of 7200000 on the same day as the fraudulent 500000 transfer xxxx allowed approximately 7200000 worth of cryptocurrency to be withdrawn from my account without any verification of my identity or fraud detection measures the funds were transferred within xxxx hour of my mobile phone being stolen and my passkeys being compromised kraken allowed these transactions to take place without applying any holds or requiring identity confirmation which is a significant failure in their fraud detection protocols lack of fraud protection and reasonable verification i have never made a transfer of this size from my kraken account nor had i ever sent money to the recipient involved the fact that kraken allowed these funds to exit without proper verification despite the abnormal circumstances such as foreign access to my account and a theft of my phone is indicative of a lack of reasonable and common sense fraud detection and protection on kraken s part the 7200000 loss in addition to the 500000 transfer that kraken is claiming i am responsible for i should not be held liable for the 7200000 worth of cryptocurrency that was fraudulently drained from my account kraken allowed this large sum of funds to leave my account without proper authentication fraud detection or any reasonable verification steps this is a blatant failure to safeguard my assets and ensure that the transactions were legitimate the lack of reasonable and common sense security measures in place at kraken is a significant part of the reason my entire savings were stolen i should not be held accountable for this loss impact on my life and financial loss as a result of krakens failure in fraud detection my entire savings consisting primarily of xxxx and xxxx were stolen i was finally able to access my account about xxxx hours later only to find that all of my savings had been drained the financial loss has been devastating given the circumstances it is unreasonable for kraken to claim that i owe them 500000 when the fraud was so easily detectable the following points should be taken into account foreign access the account was accessed from a foreign country in the middle of the night which should have raised a red flag for krakens fraud detection systems no previous transfers i have never sent a large sum from my kraken account and kraken should have recognized the transfer as suspicious deficit caused by krakens failure kraken allowed my account to go into a deficit transferring my assets without verifying my identity or applying basic fraud protection measures fraud detection by my bank my bank was able to detect and prevent fraud while kraken failed to do the same despite having control over the transfer of funds,0
